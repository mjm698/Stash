# Stash
Stash allows one to store links for later viewing. Additionally, a group of people can form a communal stash to share and comment on links together.

Todo:
    * Create user-selection dialog to add users to a stash
    
    * Implement content status on the client for viewed/updated/new
    
    * Remove debugging information
    
    * Create basic, initial stash for new users
    
    * Restyle with a color-palette
